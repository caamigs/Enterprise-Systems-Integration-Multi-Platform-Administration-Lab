A comprehensive multi-platform enterprise lab environment using VMware, integrating Windows Server Active Directory and Linux-based DNS services for centralized system administration.

## üìã Project Overview

This project demonstrates the implementation of an enterprise-grade IT infrastructure with integrated Windows and Linux systems running in a virtualized environment. The lab simulates real-world enterprise IT environments, providing hands-on experience in Windows/Linux systems administration and virtualization.

## üèóÔ∏è Architecture

The environment includes:

- **VMware Virtualization Platform** for hosting all server and client systems
- **Windows Server Domain Controller** with Active Directory implementation
- **Linux-based DNS Server** with forward and reverse lookup zones
- **VLAN-based Network Segmentation** for security and management
- **Remote Management** capabilities via SSH and remote desktop protocols

## üõ†Ô∏è Core Components

### Windows Domain Environment
- Active Directory implementation with organizational units
- Group policy configuration and management
- User and group permission structure
- Resource sharing and access control

### Linux Services
- DNS server configuration with forward and reverse lookup zones
- SSH server for remote management
- Custom shell scripts for administration tasks
- Service management and monitoring

### Network Configuration
- VLAN implementation and management
- Static IP addressing scheme
- Network security policies
- Remote access configuration

### Automation
- PowerShell scripts for Windows management tasks
- Bash scripts for Linux administration
- Scheduled maintenance tasks
- User provisioning automation

## üìä Implementation Details

### Active Directory Structure
